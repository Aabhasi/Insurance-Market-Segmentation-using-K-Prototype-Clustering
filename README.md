# Insurance Market Segmentation using K-Prototypes Clustering

This project addresses Floridaâ€™s residential insurance crisis by developing a data-driven segmentation model that helps insurers optimize pricing and manage risk exposure in Panama City.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
- Segment residential properties into risk-based clusters using mixed-type data.
- Identify key risk factors influencing insurance premiums.
- Recommend strategic underwriting actions for improved profitability and risk balance.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Techniques
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**
- **Precisely API** for flood, coastal, and demographic data extraction
- **K-Prototypes Clustering** for handling both categorical and numerical variables
- **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting** for feature importance analysis
- **Elbow Method** for optimal cluster identification
- **Data preprocessing**: deduplication, missing value handling, and outlier treatment
- **Tableau**: Data Visualization

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Developed a custom **Flood Risk Score** based on elevation and flood zone proximity.
- Identified 4 property clusters with distinct risk profiles and demographic traits.
- Demonstrated limitations of ZIP code-based pricing; clustering offers fairer premium modeling.

## ðŸ’¡ Impact
Provided actionable recommendations for insurers to reduce overexposure to high-risk properties, enhance premium fairness, and tap into low-risk growth segments through tailored product offerings.
